            <p>
                Since I was a kid, I was fascinated by turrets. Machines that would "look" at you, following your every move.
                I always wanted to build one, and I finally did it. This project is a simple sentry turret that is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4B.
                <br>
                I used legos as a fun way to build the structure of the turret. My childhood is filled with LEGOs. I clocked in hundreds of hours designing and building with them.
                So to build this chassis, I had more than enough LEGO Technic pieces from the graveyard of LEGOS at my parent's house.
                <br>
                The turret is powered by two LEGO Medium Linear Motor V46, which are controlled by a python script that uses OpenCV to track the movement of a person.
                <br>
                OpenCV is a library that is used to process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even track movement. It was great to work with,
                even with an underpowered Raspberri Pi. The image displayed around 14fps, but that was enough to move the motors in a direction that would follow the person's face.
