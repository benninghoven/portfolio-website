            This all started when I wanted to host my own Minecraft
            server. Then I wanted to host my own web server, as well as
            run my own locally operated smart home. One rack later,
            I am now a proud owner of a homelab, and it has enabled
            me to host game servers for friends to play on, as well
            as manage most of my applications from the comfort of my
            own home, and electricity bill!

        <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14597939940/Aquarium-Tycoon"> ROBLOX website </a>
        <body> This was my attempt at making a video game. I chose the
            roblox game engine because of my familiarity to the platform
            as well as how they implement the multiplayer aspect -
            it is done for you.

            This game took over my life for a couple weeks. I started with
            something simple and it got more and more complex. I learned more
            about the game engine than the language itself, LuaU, a language forked
            from Lua that adds more restriction to keep the players safe
            such as denying access to the host memory system.
            This was also my introduction to 3D design, as I needed to make my
            own low-poly fish in Blender.

        <a href="https://github.com/benninghoven/moneydash">Github Repository</a>
        <body> I was tired of using mobile apps to view my money such as
            checkings, savings, stocks and other assets. I decided to use
            an opensource data displayer (metabase) and pipe my own data
            to it. I used python for this project and sqlite to store my information.
            I was able to use the API from my major banking insitutions such as
            Bank of America and Wells Fargo as well as Robinhood and Coinbase.
            Basically, every 6 hours each API is hit and pulled information I want,
            such as balance or stock data. It is hosted locally on my servers and is
            only accessible in my network, so I don't have to worry about outside users.

        <body> My good friend Logan Corrente wanted to develop a game together
            under the microsoft framework Monogame, which was used heavily to develop
            games for the Xbox 360. I say framework and not game engine, because it
            is as barebones as it gets. You want physics? Make it. As challenging as this was,
            it was a great indtrocution to C# and microsofts SDK platform. We didn't complete the game
            but I sank a considerable time playing with it.

        <body> For my last year at community college, I was tasked with building
            a carnival game. I decided to make a strongman with a twist.
            Instead of hitting a hammer on a pin that measures your strength, I'd
            use a microphone to pickup the ambient decibel level to see how loud
            someone can scream.
            We used a raspberry pi to run this project as well as a USB microphone
            to hear the surroundings.

            We recieved first place for our efforts in the classroom.

        <body> This was my first real project. I had a problem, a discord server that needed moderation. I was able to leverage python to 
            automatically remove certain inappropriate messages from users as well as keep channels organized. Everyone starts somewhere, and
            most people start with Discord Bots.
